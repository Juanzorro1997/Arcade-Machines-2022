# Arcade-Machines-2022

**Important Requirements**

You need to start the game on the beta x86-64 -Chronium +64 -bit binaries for the games to work properly.

Right click on the game in the Steam Library -> click Properties ->Betas->Select "beta x86-64 -Chronium +64 -bit binaries" and let the game update in restarting.

**Introduction**

Are you bored and don't know how to have fun?

Here you have a set of 9 arcade machines that will make you have fun.

These machines are based on 9 classic games.

I have removed the flash player to make it compatible to play today.

I had read many people that the old addons didn't work because of the flash player so I decided to make this new addon.

I hope you enjoy.


**Information**

The modification of the model, the texture, the code and the compilation are done by me.

The original models and textures are from other people.

Here I leave the list with the following owners:

* Asteroids by Delinx in Sketchfab

* Donkey Kong by YdeJonge in Sketchfab

* Kirby by Leon Da Kimchi in Sketchfab

* Pacman by Matthew in Sketchfab

* Pokemon by Selien Labee in Sketchfab

* Sonic by Gozer in 3D Warehouse

* Street Fighter 2 by bvbwork510524 in Sketchfab

* Super Mario Bros by Harold P. de Boer in Sketchfab

* Tetris by Gozer in 3D Warehouse

I have modified the addon code of other Workshop addons so that they can play without problems.


**Configuration**

In the Pacman, Super Mario Bros and Asteroids games the settings and controls are already predetermined.

In the rest of the games there is the following:

Press TAB to open the settings window and change your in-game keyboard controls. This is applied once the game is loaded.

TAB -> Input (general) -> Player 1 (Controls) -> There are many buttons but normally "P1 Button 1" and "P1 Button 2" are used as "A" and "B" in game console.

At the top right you have two options to activate sound or full screen in the window.
